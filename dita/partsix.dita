            <title>End of an Evil Existence</title>
            <p>An angry Gaston turns the town against the beast, leading them to march over and
                storm the castle. Gaston confronts the beast and attacks him, shooting and injuring
                him badly. While attempting to get back up off the ground, Gaston falls to his
                death, finally getting what was coming to him, even though it had been a long time
                coming. Belle, the beast, and all the inhabitants of the castle are finally safe
                from harm.</p>
